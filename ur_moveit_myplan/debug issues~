1. ros subscriber cannot subscribe two topics. If your subscribed topics have messages with timestamp headers, you can use message_filters.  http://wiki.ros.org/message_filters
   However, you cannot use message_filters to subscribe msg without timestamp header. 
   See why cannot use message_filters:
   Reference: https://answers.ros.org/question/219332/how-can-i-subscribers-multiple-topics-to-get-data-at-the-same-time-python/
           https://answers.ros.org/question/196065/subscribe-to-multiple-topics-and-callback-function/
           https://answers.ros.org/question/186281/problem-using-callback-with-multiple-arguments-via-approximatetime-synchronizer/


   Therefore, for those std_msgs, we need to create manually a new message with header.
   Steps for creating a new message:
   1) Create msg file in your package 
      Use fomart as: Message_Type Name
      http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingMsgAndSrv
   2) Write a node which can both subscribe and publish. It subscribes the topics with no-header message, and publish to a new topic with new-header message.
      a. Import: from YOUR_PACKAGE.msg import MESSAGE_FILE_NAME
         Ref: see how to import your customed message: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CustomMessagePublisherSubscriber%28python%29
      b. Subscriber function: Declare the node and subscriber
         Ref: how to write a subscriber: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28python%29
      c. Callback funtion: Declare the publisher
                           Instantialize your message: msg = YOUR_MESSAGE_NAME()
			   Copy the old value from subscribed topic or give new value to your new message.

2. when running S-Model Driver Node, an error like [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/.ros/rosdep/sources.cache/index' occurs
Solution: sudo rosdep fix-permissions

3. How to run apriltag package.
Solution: 1. Modify example.launch
             1) remap the topic correctly
                <remap from="image_rect" to="/usb_cam/image_rect" />
                <remap from="camera_info" to="/usb_cam/camera_info"/>
	     2) Give unique frame id to each tag id
                [{id: 0, size: 0.07211, frame_id: april_tag_frame_id_0},
	         {id: 1, size: 0.163513, frame_id: april_tag_frame_id_1},
	         {id: 2, size: 0.163513, frame_id: april_tag_frame_id_2},
	         {id: 3, size: 0.163513, frame_id: april_tag_frame_id_3},
	         {id: 4, size: 0.163513, frame_id: april_tag_frame_id_4},
	         {id: 5, size: 0.163513, frame_id: april_tag_frame_id_5}]
	     Reference: https://github.com/personalrobotics/apriltags/issues/23 (For explanation)
			https://github.com/vkee/slam/blob/master/launch/run_apriltag_detection.launch (For launch file example)
	  2. Open the following nodes by order:
	     roslaunch usb_cam usb_cam-test.launch
	     ROS_NAMESPACE=usb_cam rosrun image_proc image_proc
	     roslaunch apriltags_ros apriltags_ros.launch
	     ## Now launch only apriltags_ros.launch should be enough because usb_cam and image_proc nodes are integrated into apriltags launch.
